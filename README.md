# 🎀 Fashion Outlet PHP Project

Welcome to my **Fashion Outlet** PHP project! This repository contains PHP examples from my module exercises, recreated and adapted into a stylish fashion outlet theme. I chose examples that were challenging or new to me to level up my PHP skills. ✨

## 🌸 Project Overview

In this project, I focused on these PHP topics:

### 1️⃣ Conditional Statements
Used to manage inventory, apply discounts, and handle user selections in the fashion outlet.

### 2️⃣ PHP Loops & Match Expressions
Used to display product lists, shopping cart items, and repeated tasks efficiently.

### 3️⃣ Using `include` Statements
Created reusable components like headers, footers, and navigation for clean, modular code.
